            <p>Hi! My name is Eric Lloyd Bunag. My friends just call me Eric, but you can call me Lloyd if that 
                one rolls better on your tongue. I'm from the Philippines, and I live in the southern island of Mindanao!</p>
            <p>I'm looking to have a degree in software development, so that I can move closer to my dream of being in 
                the game dev industry. And if that doesn't work, I can have a normal job just creating software. 
                When I'm not studying, I watch anime, draw, play Dungeons and Dragons with my online friends, or work on my 
                passion project, which is a game.</p>
