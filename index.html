            <p>Hi! My name is Eric Lloyd Bunag. My friends just call me Eric, but you can call me Lloyd if that 
                one rolls better on your tongue. I'm from the Philippines, and I live in the southern island of Mindanao!</p>
            <p>I'm looking to have a degree in software development, so that I can move closer to my dream of being in 
                the game dev industry. And if that doesn't work, I can have a normal job just creating software. 
                When I'm not studying, I watch anime, draw, play Dungeons and Dragons with my online friends, or work on my 
                passion project, which is a game.</p>

              <p>The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is an archipelagic country in Southeast 
                Asia. In the western Pacific Ocean, it consists of 7,641 islands, with a total area of 300,000 square 
                kilometers, which are broadly categorized in three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, 
                Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to 
                the east, and the Celebes Sea to the south. It shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the 
                northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to the southwest, Vietnam to the 
                west, and China to the northwest. It is the world's twelfth-most-populous country, with diverse ethnicities 
                and cultures. Manila is the country's capital, and its most populated city is Quezon City. Both are within 
                Metro Manila.</p>
